This project conducts a comprehensive accessibility and equity analysis of the NJ Transit bus system. It moves behind simple route mapping to quantify the real-world accessibility around bus stops for individuals with mobility impairments. The core of the project is a comparative analysis that investigates whether a correlation exists between a neighborhood's socio-economic status (median income) or its concentration of residents with disabilities and the accessibility of its public transit infrastructure.

The final deliverable is an interactive web dashboard that visualizes these "accessibility deserts" and allows users to explore the findings on transit equity across New Jersey.

This project's key features include a sophisticated accessibility model that calculates an "Isolation Index" for thousands of bus stops by penalizing barriers like stairs and missing sidewalks. It leverages geospatial data enrichment, merging bus stop locations with demographic data from the U.S. Census Bureau using a spatial join on census tract boundaries. The project compares bus stops in the top and bottom 20% of New Jersey neighborhoods based on both median income and disability concentration. The final deliverable is an interactive web dashboard built with Plotly Dash, which visualizes the analysis results with an interactive map, sortable data tables, and summary statistics.

The tech stack for this analysis consists of Python with Pandas and GeoPandas for data manipulation; OSMnx, NetworkX, and Shapely for geospatial analysis; and the Census Data API with the Requests library for data acquisition. The interactive dashboard is built with Plotly Dash, Dash AG Grid, and Dash Bootstrap Components.

To run this project, first clone the repository and install the dependencies listed in requirements.txt. An API key from the U.S. Census Bureau must be placed in a .env file in the project root. The workflow begins by executing the src/get_census_income_data.py and src/get_census_disability_data.py scripts to acquire the necessary demographic data. Following data acquisition, run the main src/run_analysis.py script; this is the primary data processing pipeline which merges all data sources and uses the core logic from the analyzer.py module to calculate accessibility metrics for each targeted bus stop. As this step can take several hours, it saves its results to a final CSV file. Once this analysis is complete, the interactive dashboard can be launched by running src/app.py, which loads the processed data and serves the web application for visualization.

The analysis revealed a significant correlation between neighborhood design and transit accessibility. Bus stops in high-income, suburban areas were found to be, on average, less accessible than those in low-income, dense urban areas. This suggests that car-centric suburban design is a major barrier to pedestrian accessibility. Conversely, there was no significant statistical difference in accessibility between neighborhoods with high vs. low concentrations of residents with disabilities, indicating that infrastructure is not necessarily better in areas where it may be needed most.
